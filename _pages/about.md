> Advancing Food Safety Through Interdisciplinary Research in Molecular Diagnostics, Predictive Modeling, and Climate Science.

Dr. Nodali Ndraha is a Junior Researcher at Indonesia’s National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) within the Research Center for Food Technology and Processing. He is an active researcher who has contributed to multiple peer-reviewed publications in prominent international journals since 2017. His work appears in reputable journals, including <em>Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety</em>, <em>Food Control</em>, <em>Food Microbiology</em>, <em>Foods</em>, <em>Microbial Risk Analysis</em>, and others, frequently as first author. Most of his publications are indexed in databases including the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus and have received scholarly citations.

He also have presented research at scientific conferences such as IAFP’s European Symposium on Food Safety, sharing findings with the global food safety community. His work advances critical understanding in food science and microbial risk analysis.

Through his research, he has explored pathogen behavior in foods like tilapia, oysters, lettuce, and alfalfa sprouts, hoping to guide effective control strategies. His approach combines tools like PCR, predictive microbiology, QMRA, and machine learning to address microbial risks and climate change impacts. As a Principal Investigator, He hope to continue refining pathogen detection, developing AI-driven risk models, and supporting climate-resilient food safety strategies to contribute, in my small way, to public health and food security.
